# Skill-Ecosystem Cross-Source Matrix

This matrix indexes which functional areas each surveyed source
covers, with skill/command/molecule names as cell values. Functional
areas are grouped by category. Cells show the source's named
artifact(s) where coverage exists; `—` means the source ships no
named artifact in that area. **This is a coverage map, not an
evaluation.** Borrowing decisions are out of scope for this audit.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SKILL.md schema / spec authority | (defers to agentskills.io; documents schema in `writing-skills`) | (validator rules SKILL-01..07; defers schema to agentskills.io) | **CANONICAL** — spec lives at agentskills.io/specification; this repo is Anthropic's reference implementation | (not a SKILL.md ecosystem natively; installs commands AS `speckit-<name>/SKILL.md` via `SkillsIntegration`) | (not SKILL.md; uses its own `.kiro/steering/*.md` inclusion-mode frontmatter) | (not SKILL.md; uses TOML `mol-*.toml` schema for molecules) | (consumer of the same spec + Anthropic extensions: `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `context: fork`, `agent:`, etc.) |

### Harness / runtime integration

| Functional area | SP | BMAD | AN | SK | KR | GT | CC |

### Coordination meta

| Functional area | SP | BMAD | AN | SK | KR | GT | CC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Persona / named agents | — | 6 named personas (Mary, Paige, John, Sally, Winston, Amelia) with literary voice descriptors | — | — | — | 6 runtime agent roles (mayor, deacon, boot, witness, refinery, polecat — *agents*, not *skill personas*) | — |

## Gaps

Functional areas no surveyed source covers (or only covers in
passing). These are open territory if gc-toolkit needed something
in the space — useful as a coverage-gap survey, not as a "must
fill" list:

- **Cost/budget tracking for agent runs.** No source ships a skill
  for tracking model spend per task, per workflow, or per
  feature. Some sources mention model selection (Superpowers'
  `subagent-driven-development` "Model Selection" section,
  `bmad-party-mode --model haiku`) but none track or report cost.
- **Eval-result regression detection across runs.** Anthropic's
  `skill-creator` benchmarks skills, but no source ships a skill
  that compares this-week's eval results to last-week's for the
  same skill or workflow, or that flags regressions in skill
  triggering accuracy over time.
- **Documentation freshness audit.** No source ships a skill that
  walks a `docs/` tree and flags pages whose content has drifted
  from the code they describe. (BMAD's `bmad-shard-doc` and
  `bmad-index-docs` are mechanical, not staleness-aware.)
- **License / dependency compliance scanning.** No source ships a
  skill for SBOM generation, license-text scanning, or
  vulnerable-dependency detection (separate from
  `/security-review` which targets source code).
- **Database migration authoring / review.** No source ships
  schema-migration-specific skills, even though several spec
  workflows produce `data-model.md` (Spec Kit) or schemas (BMAD).
- **Performance / load testing.** `webapp-testing` covers
  functional browser testing via Playwright; no source ships
  performance-budget, load-test, or profiling skills.
- **Localization / translation.** No skills for translating
  artifacts. BMAD has `{communication_language}` /
  `{document_output_language}` config keys but no skill that
  performs translation as a workflow.
- **Accessibility audit.** No source ships an a11y-specific skill,
  though `webapp-testing` could host one.
- **Visual diff / screenshot review.** `webapp-testing` captures
  screenshots; no source produces a skill that *compares* before/
  after screenshots and flags visual regressions.
- **Knowledge-graph / capability ledger.** Gas Town's polecat
  prompt mentions a "Capability Ledger" (the beads ledger), but
  no source ships a skill that *queries* it for trends or for
  agent-capability profiling.
- **Stakeholder mail / outbound external comms drafting.**
  Anthropic's `internal-comms` covers internal; no source ships a
  customer-facing / external-stakeholder comms skill.
- **Data analysis (notebook / Jupyter).** Spreadsheet ops via
  `xlsx`; no notebook-grade exploratory analysis skill.
- **Compliance / audit-trail generation for regulated workflows.**
  No SOC-2-style audit-evidence-collection skill, though decision
  logs (BMAD, Spec Kit) and the bead ledger (Gas Town) approach
  the territory.

## Overlaps — notable convergence (2+ sources)

These are the areas where multiple independent ecosystems have
independently arrived at a skill/command for the same purpose.
Most clusters have 3+ sources; a few have only 2 but are included
because the convergence is structurally interesting. Per-cluster
counts vary; check the header on each subsection. Convergence is
evidence the pattern has been re-derived; it does not by itself
justify adoption.

### 1. Plan / task execution (5 sources)

- SP: `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`
- BMAD: `bmad-dev-story`, `bmad-quick-dev`, `bmad-agent-dev`
- SK: `/speckit.implement`
- GT: `mol-polecat-work`
- (CC: `/batch` indirectly, parallel-unit decomposition + execute)

All five ship a "take an approved plan and execute it" workflow.
The execution strategies vary widely (Superpowers prefers fresh
subagent per task; Gas Town runs a polecat per work bead; Spec Kit
walks tasks.md sequentially; BMAD's `bmad-quick-dev` collapses
the whole pipeline into one skill; `/batch` decomposes into 5-30
independent units).

### 2. Code review (correctness) (3 sources)

- SP: `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`
- BMAD: `bmad-code-review` (with three parallel review layers)
- CC: `/code-review`

Three independent ecosystems ship a code-review skill on the
current diff. BMAD's parallel-layer approach (Blind Hunter / Edge
Case Hunter / Acceptance Auditor) and Superpowers' `code-reviewer`
subagent-prompt convention sit on either side of `/code-review`'s
effort-level dial.

### 3. Debugging / root-cause investigation (3 sources)

- SP: `systematic-debugging` (with `root-cause-tracing.md` reference)
- BMAD: `bmad-investigate`
- CC: `/debug`

All three ship discipline-shaped skills for diagnosing failures
*before* fixing. Superpowers and BMAD both enforce "investigate
before fix" rules; `/debug` is more harness-integrated (reads
session logs).

### 4. Verification / app-launch (3-4 sources)

- SP: `verification-before-completion`
- AN: `webapp-testing` (browser-side)
- GT: `mol-polecat-work` self-review step (with affected-tests gate)
- CC: `/verify`, `/run`, `/run-skill-generator`

Convergence: don't claim "done" without evidence. Superpowers and
Gas Town encode the discipline; `/verify` and `webapp-testing`
provide the means.

### 5. Subagent / parallel dispatch (4 sources)

- SP: `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `subagent-driven-development`
- BMAD: parallel reviewers within `bmad-code-review`, `bmad-party-mode`
- GT: `mol-idea-to-plan` (6+ parallel review-leg dispatches)
- CC: `/batch` (5-30 isolated worktree subagents)

Four sources ship some flavor of "fan work out to multiple
independent agents." The patterns vary (Superpowers
fresh-subagent-per-task; Gas Town named review legs; `/batch`
worktree-isolated PRs; BMAD's `bmad-party-mode` real subagents per
persona). Spec Kit's `handoffs:` and Anthropic's `context: fork`
are adjacent but not equivalent: Spec Kit handoffs are sequential
UI hand-off chips between slash commands, and `context: fork` is a
Claude Code extension to the skill spec rather than a parallel-
dispatch mechanism in the public-skills repo itself.

### 6. Skill authoring / meta-skill (2 sources, +1 adjacent)

- SP: `writing-skills` (TDD-for-skills, pressure-test transcripts)
- AN: `skill-creator` (eval/benchmark/improve-description loop)
- (BMAD adjacent / partial: `bmad-customize` edits override layers
  rather than authoring new skills end-to-end; `bmad-distillator`
  compresses source docs into embeddable form. Both touch
  skill-adjacent authoring but neither is a direct counterpart to
  `writing-skills` / `skill-creator`.)

Two independent skill ecosystems each ship a true authoring meta-
skill for producing more skills, both imposing discipline on the
description-field's wording (Superpowers' "description = WHEN
only" vs. Anthropic's "include both what AND when"). BMAD's
adjacent skills cover override-editing and source-doc compression
— a related but distinct shape, and worth noting precisely because
it shows the same ecosystem can ship skill-adjacent meta-tooling
without converging on the full author-a-new-skill pattern.

### 7. Steering / always-loaded project context (4 sources)

- SK: `/speckit.constitution` → `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
  (loaded by `/speckit.plan` gate)
- KR: `inclusion: always` mode + foundational `product.md` /
  `tech.md` / `structure.md`
- GT: agent prompt templates rendered into system prompt per role
- CC: `CLAUDE.md` auto-loaded per project
- (BMAD adjacent: `bmad-generate-project-context` produces
  `project-context.md` as similar artifact)

Four (or five) sources ship some flavor of "load this context on
every interaction." Kiro's inclusion-mode is the most explicit
treatment; Spec Kit's constitution and Claude Code's CLAUDE.md are
narrower; Gas Town does it per-agent-role via prompt templates.

### 8. Filing convention — per-feature directory (4 sources)

- SP: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- SK: `specs/<NNN-or-timestamp>-<slug>/{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  (THE CANONICAL `specs/<feature>/` PATTERN)
- KR: `.kiro/specs/<feature>/{requirements,design,tasks}.md`
- GT: `worktrees/<bead-id>/` (work isolation) and `specs/<bead-id>/`
  (artifact filing; in gc-toolkit per `docs/file-structure.md`)

Spec Kit and Kiro converge exactly on `specs/<feature>/`. gc-toolkit
follows the same shape with bead-keyed names
(`specs/<bead-id>/`). Superpowers uses timestamp prefixes in
`docs/superpowers/`. The convergence on per-feature directories
(rather than per-doc-type or chronological-only) is striking.

### 9. Hooks / lifecycle integration (3 sources)

- SP: `hooks/hooks.json` (SessionStart on startup|clear|compact)
- SK: `.specify/extensions.yml` (before/after per command)
- CC: settings.json `hooks` (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse,
  etc.)

Three independent harness-integration patterns. Superpowers and
Claude Code share the `SessionStart` hook name; Spec Kit's
extensions.yml runs hooks per command rather than per session
event.

### 10. Customization / override layer (4 sources)

- BMAD: `customize.toml` three-layer merge (base → team → user)
- SK: template stack (`overrides/` → `presets/` → `extensions/` →
  core)
- KR: workspace `.kiro/steering/` > global `~/.kiro/steering/`
- GT: rig `formula_vars` overrides molecule `default`
- (CC: `skillOverrides` in settings.json — narrower; visibility,
  not content override)

Four sources ship layered-override systems for skill / command /
workflow customization. The merge semantics differ (BMAD's
"arrays-of-tables keyed by code or id" is the most-structured;
Kiro's straight precedence is the simplest).

### 11. Persona / role-shaped agents (2 sources, +1 adjacent)

- BMAD: 6 named personas (Mary, Paige, John, Sally, Winston, Amelia)
  with literary voice descriptors
- GT: 6 runtime agent roles (mayor, deacon, boot, witness, refinery,
  polecat — agents, not skill personas, but role-shaped)
- (SP adjacent: subagent prompts are role-shaped — implementer,
  spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer — but anonymous, and SP is
  marked absent in the persona/named-agents matrix row above
  because it ships no named-persona convention.)

Two sources organize agent labor by named role, with Superpowers
adjacent via anonymous role-shaped subagent prompts. BMAD's
personas layer onto workflow skills (Mary stays "Mary" when she
runs the brainstorming skill); Gas Town's roles are runtime
agents bound to molecules. The two named-role ecosystems are
structurally distinct but functionally overlapping: both partition
agentic work by named role.

### 12. Recurring loops / patrol (2 sources, +1 adjacent)

- GT: `mol-deacon-patrol`, `mol-witness-patrol`, `mol-refinery-patrol`
- CC: `/loop`, `/schedule`
- (BMAD adjacent: `bmad-sprint-status` runs as a manual check, not
  on a loop)

Two ecosystems explicitly model recurring / cron-like work. Gas
Town's patrol pattern (pour-next-wisp + burn-current) is
distinctive: a self-pouring loop that survives crashes by always
leaving the next iteration's wisp assigned before burning the
current. Claude Code's `/loop` and `/schedule` cover the same
ground via the harness's session scheduler instead.
