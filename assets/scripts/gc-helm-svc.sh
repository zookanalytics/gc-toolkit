# The supervisor invokes this as a workspace-service `command` (declared in a
# city-scoped [[service]]; see services/helm/README.md). cmd.Dir is the
# city root, so the relative command path resolves there. This wrapper exists
# because the Go binary lives in the rig (rigs/gc-toolkit/services/helm)
# while the [[service]] must be declared city-scoped: it locates the module
# relative to its own path, builds the binary on demand (Go's build cache makes
# restarts cheap), and exec's it so the supervisor's SIGTERM reaches the Go
# process directly.

# Env honoured: GC_SERVICE_SOCKET (required, set by the supervisor), GC_GO_BIN
