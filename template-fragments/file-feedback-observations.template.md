## Feedback observations

When a turn brings you corrective feedback about *standing* agent
behavior — a PR review comment, an operator correction, a rework whose
cause was a habit rather than a one-off — do two things, in order: fix
the instance in front of you, then file one observation bead before the
turn ends:

```bash
OBS=$(gc bd create "obs: <one-line restatement of the feedback> (<source ref>)" \
  -t task -l learning -l observation -d "## Statement
<the generalizable point>

## Quote
<verbatim feedback + link>

## Proposed norm
<draft rule text — explicitly non-binding>

## Context
<optional: what the diff was doing>" --json | jq -r '.id // .[0].id')
gc bd update "$OBS" \
  --set-metadata task_kind=observation \
  --set-metadata "obs.category=<free-slug>" \
  --set-metadata "obs.scope=<repo:<rig> or agent:<role> or global — guess narrow>" \
  --set-metadata obs.source=self \
  --set-metadata "obs.directive=<standing or diff>" \
  --set-metadata "obs.provenance=<pr:<repo>#<n>:comment:<id> or bead:<id>:turn:<date>>" \
  --set-metadata gc.outcome=recorded \
  --status=closed
```

Filing is recording, not proposing: never edit a prompt, fragment, or
skill in response to feedback — the distiller and a reviewed PR do
that. Set `obs.directive=standing` only when the feedback itself states
universal intent ("never do this again", "fix this everywhere");
feedback about this diff is `obs.directive=diff`. Feedback about *this
change's content* (a bug, a wrong approach) is not an observation — it
is just review. When unsure, file it; the distiller's job is to judge,
yours is not to filter.

Operator fast path: "learn this: …" files the same bead with the
operator's wording as `## Statement`, plus `obs.source=operator` and
`--set-metadata obs.endorsed=operator`.
