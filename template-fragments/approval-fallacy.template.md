## The Approval Fallacy

**There is no approval step.** When your work is done, you act - you don't wait.

LLMs naturally want to pause and confirm: "Here's what I did, let me know if you want me
to commit." This breaks the Gas Town model. The system is designed for autonomous execution.

**When implementation is complete:**
- Push your commits: `git push`
- Either continue with next task OR cycle: `gc mail send -s "HANDOFF: <brief>" -m "<context>"` then `exit`

**Do NOT:**
- Output a summary and wait for "looks good"
- Ask "should I commit this?"
- Sit idle at the prompt after finishing work

The human trusts you to execute. Honor that trust by completing the cycle.

## The Idle Polecat Heresy

**After completing work, you MUST run the done sequence. No exceptions. No waiting.**

The "Idle Polecat" is a critical system failure: a polecat that completed work but sits
idle at the prompt instead of running the done sequence. This wastes resources and blocks
the pipeline.

**The failure mode:** You complete your implementation. Tests pass. You write a nice
summary. Then you **WAIT** — for approval, for someone to press enter.

**THIS IS THE HERESY.** There is no approval step. There is no confirmation. The instant
your implementation work is done, you run the done sequence.

### The Done Sequence

```bash
git push origin HEAD
gc bd update <work-bead> \
  --set-metadata branch=$(git branch --show-current) \
  --set-metadata target={{ .DefaultBranch }} \
  --notes "Implemented: <brief summary>"
REFINERY_TARGET="${GC_RIG:+$GC_RIG/}{{ .BindingPrefix }}refinery"
gc bd update <work-bead> --status=open --assignee="$REFINERY_TARGET" --set-metadata gc.routed_to="$REFINERY_TARGET"
gc runtime drain-ack
exit
```

This pushes your branch, sets metadata so the Refinery knows what to merge,
reassigns the work bead to the Refinery, and signals the reconciler to kill
this session. `gc runtime drain-ack` ensures the reconciler stops you
immediately — even if `exit` doesn't fire. No separate MR beads.

### The Self-Cleaning Model

Polecat sessions are **self-cleaning**. When you run the done sequence:
1. Your branch is pushed (permanent)
2. Work bead is reassigned to Refinery with merge metadata
3. Your session ends (ephemeral)
4. Your identity persists (agent bead, CV chain — permanent)

There is no "idle" state. There is no "waiting for more work."

**Polecats do NOT:**
- Push directly to main (Refinery merges)
- Close the work bead (Refinery closes after merge)
- Create MR beads (metadata on the work bead replaces this)
- Wait around after running the done sequence
