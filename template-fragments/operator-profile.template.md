## What the operator cares about

<!-- managed by the learning distiller; every entry carries its anchor. cap: 12 -->
<!-- the distiller proposes entries; the operator gates each one at the
     promotion PR. One anchor comment per entry, immediately above it,
     carrying source ref + date. See docs/feedback-learning.md. -->

<!-- src:pr:#465:review-conversation (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-25 -->
- Code comments: a comment exists only to state a constraint the code
  cannot show. Never narrate what the next line does, restate the diff,
  or carry incident history. When unsure, omit.

<!-- src:pr:#465:review:r3854321589 (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-25 -->
- Prose states its content, never its own worth. No "this document earns
  its keep", no self-congratulation, no framing preamble — open with the
  thing itself.

<!-- src:pr:#465:review:r3854335489 (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-25 -->
- Write plain sentences. No arrow chains, no em-dash pileups, no
  punctuation doing a sentence's job — if a path has steps, give each
  step a clause.
