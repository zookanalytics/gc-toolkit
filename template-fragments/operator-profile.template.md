## What the operator cares about

<!-- managed by the learning distiller; every entry carries its anchor. cap: 12 -->
<!-- the distiller proposes entries; the operator gates each one at the
     promotion PR. One anchor comment per entry, immediately above it,
     carrying source ref + date. See docs/feedback-learning.md. -->

<!-- rule:tk-vglpm src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- Lead operator-facing writing with the decision or the action, stated so it
  can be accepted or rejected in place. Reasoning comes after it, and bare
  bead ids are not a decision.

<!-- rule:tk-3znt49 src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- The operator's own queues are state, not items to relay: a PR awaiting
  their review, work already routed, an approval already pending. When work
  has a proven remedy and raises no policy question, sling it instead of
  asking them to fund it.

<!-- rule:tk-uzkg2c src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- Derive a load-bearing claim at the moment you make it, and check that the
  evidence you cite discriminates. A premise inherited from a bead body, a
  design doc, or one transient measurement is an assertion, not evidence.

<!-- rule:tk-b80kkz src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- A rename, a re-framing, or a rendering change is not a fix for the thing
  that produced the symptom. Take a report at the severity it was filed and
  look for the structural cause.

<!-- rule:tk-lz8mpv src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- Read a standing ruling for its intent. A balance ask is not a freeze and a
  throttle is not a permission gate, so do not hold work behind a decision
  the operator never gave.

<!-- rule:tk-tketyk src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- File work as a bead in the pass that names it, and put the bead id in the
  row that proposed it. A prose promise loses members of a set.

<!-- rule:tk-vbyak0 src:pr:#465:review-conversation, bead:tk-447ql0, pr:#490:comment:3868559694 (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-27 -->
- Living code and documents — comments, prompts, formula steps, docs —
  state what is true now and the constraints it rests on; never narrate
  what the next line does, restate the diff, or carry incident history,
  dates, or bead and PR ids. Specs and commit messages are where history
  belongs; when unsure, omit. Managed provenance anchors are the one
  exception. The HTML comment above a learned rule is metadata, and the
  learning loop requires it to name a source ref and an adoption date.

<!-- rule:tk-xgaeo src:audit:tk-awa7hv adopted:2026-08-26 -->
- Documentation states what is true now, in the present tense. No "replaces
  the old X", no proposed-amendment section, no rule justified by the history
  of the change that produced it — the commit is the changelog.

<!-- src:pr:#465:review:r3854321589 (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-25 -->
- Prose states its content, never its own worth. No "this document earns
  its keep", no self-congratulation, no framing preamble — open with the
  thing itself.

<!-- src:pr:#465:review:r3854335489 (operator feedback) adopted:2026-08-25 -->
- Write plain sentences. No arrow chains, no em-dash pileups, no
  punctuation doing a sentence's job — if a path has steps, give each
  step a clause.
