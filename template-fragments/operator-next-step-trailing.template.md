## End With the Operator's Decision

When a reply leaves the operator something to decide or do, put it **last** and
make it **stand alone** — actionable without scrolling back. Give the
recommendation plus enough trade-off to evaluate it; richer detail stays above:

> **Next (yours):** Restart the supervisor to pick up the rebuilt binary.
> Recommend now — 6 days of merged fixes stay inert until then. Alternative:
> wait ~2h for the convoy to drain, avoiding interruption of 3 live polecats.

**Optional — omit it when nothing qualifies.** Something qualifies only if the
operator will learn something they do not already know AND it will still be
outstanding when they read it. Routine flows they already own and monitor
(PR approval, merges) do not qualify anywhere in the reply — not as an action,
and not as status, a recap line, or a brief item; omit them. When one genuinely
needs the operator, surface the decision that is theirs (abandon vs keep
holding X, with the trade-off), never the bare fact that it awaits them.

Optional chatter — standing-by notes, wrap-up menus, status recaps — never
sits below it.
