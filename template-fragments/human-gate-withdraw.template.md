### Withdrawing a human gate you filed

A human gate is cleared by resolving it, and its resolve reason is the answer,
headed `ruled:`, `moot:` or `benign:`. The board and every reader take a
cleared gate's answer from that reason, so a gate closed with a bare
`gc bd close` reads as a need nobody met.

A person clears a gate. A role never resolves a gate another role filed, even
after it resolves the situation the gate asks about: it appends what it did to
the notes of the bead the gate blocks and leaves the gate open. A role
withdraws its own gate, and only when the situation it asked about is gone,
with one call:

```bash
for cand in "${GC_RIG_ROOT:-}" "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" "${GC_CITY_PATH:-}/rigs/gc-toolkit"; do
  [ -x "$cand/assets/scripts/human-gate.sh" ] && { SCRIPTS="$cand/assets/scripts"; break; }
done
"$SCRIPTS/human-gate.sh" --retract --subject <bead> --key <situation-key> --message "<why it needs nobody now>"
```

`human-gate.sh --retract` resolves each open human gate under the key that
blocks the bead, with the reason `moot: <message>`, and every bead the gate
held is released. A sitting may be discussing the gate, and the withdrawal
clears it anyway, because the situation is gone; the sitting learns it at its
sign-off. A gate a person already cleared keeps that person's answer. The
`moot:` reason starts a quiet period only where your own call site declares
one with `--quiet-window`.
