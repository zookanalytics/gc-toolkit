# Gas City routing model: sling vs assignee vs `--reassign`

## Scope

**Mandate.** How the three ways of moving a bead to a worker differ —
`gc sling <target> <bead>` (queue/template routing), `bd update
--assignee` (direct named-session delivery), and `gc sling --reassign`
(combined unassign + route) — and which of `assignee` / `gc.routed_to`
each lane is supposed to set, per the maintainer's PR #1736 ruling.

**Boundaries.** This doc covers *how* work moves between agents, not
*who* the agents are — agent variants, identity, and lifecycle are
[gascity-agents.md](gascity-agents.md). It is anchored to the #1736
ruling and the `--reassign` mechanics (PR #1841); it is not a general
`gc sling` tutorial, and graph.v2 step routing (`gc.run_target`)
appears only as an adjacent contrast, not as the doc's subject.

## The maintainer's ruling

From julianknutsen's PR #1736 closing comment, verbatim — the lead
sentence:

> `assignee` and `gc.routed_to` are not duplicates, and the default
> sling path should not generally stamp both.

And, verbatim, the decision list at the end of the same comment:

> - Do not merge this PR.
> - Keep `gc sling` as queue/template routing: `gc.routed_to=<target>`,
>   no `assignee` by default.
> - For named-session delivery, assign the named-session identity
>   directly: `bd update <bead> --assignee <named-session-identity>`.
> - Clean up the Gastown polecat/refinery formula and prompt text that
>   currently says to set both `assignee` and `gc.routed_to`; that is
>   bad hygiene and can become stale-route confusion later, even if the
>   current direct-assignee path still works.

The three lanes below are the resulting model.

## The three lanes

### Lane 1 — `gc sling <target> <bead>`: queue / template routing

- **When to use:** routing a bead to a pool, queue, or template — the
  cases where any worker matching the target is acceptable. This is
  the default sling path and the dispatch shape used by mayor,
  mechanik, deacon, and refinery when handing work back to the
  polecat pool.
- **Sets:** `metadata.gc.routed_to=<target>`. Leaves `assignee` empty.
- **CLI example:**
  ```bash
  gc sling gc-toolkit/gc-toolkit.polecat tk-abcde
  ```
- **Does NOT:** set `assignee`. The reconciler picks an available
  worker from the pool by matching `gc.routed_to`.

### Lane 2 — `bd update <bead> --assignee <named-session>`: direct named-session delivery

- **When to use:** the work must land on one specific named session
  (e.g., a polecat resuming its own bead, mechanik claiming its own
  wisp, mail addressed to a specific identity). When you write the
  named session's identity, you're saying "this work, this agent,
  no fan-out."
- **Sets:** `assignee=<named-session-identity>`. Leaves
  `gc.routed_to` empty.
- **CLI example:**
  ```bash
  bd update tk-abcde --assignee gc-toolkit/gc-toolkit.mechanik
  ```
- **Does NOT:** set `gc.routed_to`. The named session's hook query
  finds the work via assignee, not via routed metadata.

### Lane 3 — `gc sling <target> <bead> --reassign`: combined unassign + route

- **When to use:** park-then-handoff transitions — a human or named
  session was working on the bead, the work is now bouncing back to a
  pool. The single flag clears the prior assignee and routes in one
  step so the bead is never momentarily double-stamped. Added in
  PR #1841 (merged 2026-05-12) to make this transition atomic from
  the caller's perspective.
- **Sets:** `metadata.gc.routed_to=<target>` and clears `assignee`
  to empty.
- **CLI example:**
  ```bash
  gc sling gc-toolkit/gc-toolkit.polecat tk-abcde --reassign
  ```
- **Does NOT:** stamp a new assignee. The combined behavior is *clear*
  + *route*, never *clear* + *re-assign-to-someone-else*.

#### `--reassign` idempotency

`TestDoSling_Reassign_NoOpWhenAlreadyEmpty`
(`rigs/gascity/internal/sling/sling_test.go:3809`) pins the
contract: when `assignee` is already empty, `--reassign` is a no-op
on the assignee field — no error, no spurious update. Callers that
don't know the bead's prior state can pass `--reassign`
unconditionally and trust the routing call to be safe.

### Adjacent — `gc.run_target` (graph.v2 step routing)

`gc.run_target` is metadata on individual template steps inside
graph.v2 formula files (e.g., `mol-review-quorum.toml`), not
per-bead routing. It lives at a different layer than the three
sling lanes above: those route a single bead between agents,
while `gc.run_target` routes a step within a formula expansion.
Don't conflate it with `gc.routed_to` when you see it in formula
files.

## Note: upstream tutorial wording

`docs/tutorials/06-beads.md` (upstream) still says, at line ~389:

> Work is routed to an agent (via assignee or `gc.routed_to`
> metadata)

This conflates Lanes 1 and 2 as parallel routing paths. It is
superseded by the PR #1736 ruling and is expected to be updated by
upstream on its own schedule. Per the gc-toolkit
`upstream-engagement` posture, we do not pre-empt that update; this
local doc is authoritative inside gc-toolkit until upstream catches
up. The upstream `docs/reference/cli.md` already covers the
mechanical `--reassign` flag (one table row at `cli.md:2789`); it
does not cover the broader three-lane model.
